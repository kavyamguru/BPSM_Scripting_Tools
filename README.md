# BPSM_Scripting_Tools

Practical Linux, Bash, AWK, Python, Git, and HPC scripting exercises developed for MSc Bioinformatics systems training.

## Objective
Build operational command-line proficiency for real-world bioinformatics workflows: data parsing, automation, job submission, and reproducible scripting habits.

## Included Skills
- Bash control flow and scripting patterns
- Text processing with AWK
- Basic Python scripting for data handling
- BLAST command-line usage and result filtering
- Linux shell fluency and file-system operations
- Git command workflow essentials
- HPC execution concepts (Eddie job usage notes)

## Repository Contents
Representative files include:
- loop/variable scripting examples (`bash_loops.sh`, `bash_variables.sh`)
- Bash↔AWK integration (`bash_to_awk.sh`, `myawkscript.awk`)
- BLAST examples and post-processing (`blast.sh`, `good_or_bad_BLAST.sh`)
- HPC cheat sheet (`eddie.sh`)
- Git usage notes (`git_cheatsheet.md`)

## Career Relevance
This repository highlights foundational systems skills required by bioinformatics roles:
- Unix-first working style
- script-based automation
- reliable command-line data processing
- environment readiness for pipeline and HPC work
